        <div id="Featured_playlists">
            <!-- 1. Title and subtitle.
                2. Create the playlist cards. Not that hard after creating one card. Make the design before hand -->

        <div id="Recommended_albums">
            <!-- 1. Title and subtitle.
                2.Create a searchbar with a magnifying glass icon. Apply hover effects. One very good hover effect that I found is this. Atleast I will change the colours and all but overall I want to make something like this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txr6mkqNjGc
                3. Add album cards just like we made in featured_playlists. Probably knowing the template will help a lot.
                4. This seems hardest and I quite don't understand it myself but here's the bit ".Implement hover effects on the album cards to expand in size and reveal a "Know More" button." -->
        </div>
        <div id="User_reviews">
            <!-- 1. Again Title and subtitle.
                2. Split into two parts
                3. In first part, make cards again but they should contain reviews and images of the people reviewing.
                4. In second part, make a form which takes various params. -->
            <!-- It should be clearly observant by now that each section of the question reuses the contents learned in the previous section and adds it's own contribution which is passed to the next section. All lessons are listed at the end of  the body -->

        <div>
            <!-- Footer
            Surprisingly, it's almost similar to header (it's not fixed btw, look at bottom of aakash.ac.in for reference), with addition to icon putting, flexboxes, hover effects, linking, opening in new tab and finally a simple href to top of the page -->
        </div>
    </body>
    <!-- Lessons tested were:
    1. Title and a low-level card
    2. Subtitle 
    3. Highly detailed cards
    4. Search bar
    5. Hover effects (and going advanced on it)
    6. Making forms-->
